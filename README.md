CSCI2270 Final Project

Project Summary:
This program works as an inventory for fashion companies and retail stores. What this program does is keep an inventory of the stock of clothes that a certain store has; then, the customer can search for specific attributes of a certain item of clothing they are looking for. The program will then search through the inventory to see if we have any matching items. If there are no matching items, the program will bring up similar items as suggestions.  The inventory for the store will be built using a tree structure and will have linked lists integrated into it. The different search filters that our program will be able to do are: type (examples: shirt, dress, pants), color (examples: red, blue, black), style (examples: retro, boho, modern), designers (examples: Guess, Gucci, Pink), and length (examples: short, long, medium).  The program will have the assumption hat all sizes and price ranges are accounted for.
